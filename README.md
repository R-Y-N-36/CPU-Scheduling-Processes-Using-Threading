# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Using Threading

This repository contains Python implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms utilizing threading for concurrent execution. The algorithms included are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), High Response Ratio Next (HRRN), and Round Robin (RR). 

## Features

- Implements four common CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Utilizes threading for simultaneous execution of algorithms.
- User-friendly input for process arrival times and CPU burst times.
- Displays Gantt charts and calculates average waiting and response times.

## Algorithms

1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**:
   - Processes are scheduled in the order of their arrival.
  
2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**:
   - The process with the smallest burst time is scheduled next.

3. **High Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**:
   - Considers both waiting time and burst time to prioritize processes.

4. **Round Robin (RR)**:
   - Each process is assigned a fixed time slice in a cyclic order.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CPU-Scheduling-Processes-Using-Threading.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CPU-Scheduling-Processes-Using-Threading
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```
2. Follow the prompts to input arrival times and CPU burst times for processes.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter Arrival Time of Process 1: 0
Enter CBT Time of Process 1: 4
Enter Arrival Time of Process 2: 1
Enter CBT Time of Process 2: 3
...
```

After inputting the details, the program will display the Gantt charts and average waiting/response times for each scheduling algorithm.
