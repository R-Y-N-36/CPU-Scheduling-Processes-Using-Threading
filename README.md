# CPU-Scheduling-Processes-Using-Threading
This repository contains a Python implementation of four CPU scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), High Response Ratio Next (HRRN), and Round Robin (RR). The main file (Main.py) orchestrates the execution of these algorithms using threads.
